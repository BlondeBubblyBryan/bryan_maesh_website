                        </h2>
                        In all our Services we adhere to Singapore‚Äôs Personal Data Protection Act.

                        If any dispute (‚ÄúDispute‚Äù) arises out of or relating to this Agreement, or to the interpretation, breach, termination or validity of this Agreement, Maesh and the merchant must use their best efforts to resolve the Dispute through consultation or mediation.
                        If a Dispute is not settled within 30 days, the Dispute must be referred to and resolved by arbitration in Singapore in accordance with the Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (‚ÄúSIAC‚Äù).  The tribunal will consist of one arbitrator, to be appointed by the President of the SIAC.  The language of the arbitration will be English.
                        Fees
                        The transaction fees (‚ÄúFees‚Äù) that we charge for our services are specified on our main landing page. We reserve the right to revise our Fees  at any time, but we will give prior notice to existing merchants on our platform. Our Fees are automatically deducted from the money settled to you at payout days.

                        Maesh is not responsible for your product or service. Any losses that may occur because of errors arising from, but not limited to, erroneous transactions, whether by misconfiguration or by faulty behavior from those you accept payments from (your ‚ÄúCustomer‚Äù) are carried by you. We provide no warranty for any of the services we provide.

                        </h2>
                        Maesh has been granted an exemption by the Monetary Authority Singapore (MAS) from holding a license under the Payment Services Act for providing Merchant Acquisition Services until January 28, 2021. Maesh is allowed to continue to provide such services pursuant to the Payment Services (Exemption for Specified Period) Regulations 2019.

                        Maesh offers Payment Processing Services for you to accept payments from your Customers. Even though Maesh does this through Corporate PayNow, we also accept these payments (‚ÄúTransactions‚Äù) on your behalf in order to automate the reconciliation of both the payment and the order.

                            6. Refunds
                        </h2>
                        Unlike cards, bank transfers are irreversible. Therefore, when using Maesh as a payment gateway, you will not have to deal with chargebacks or any fines/fees associated with it. It is possible, however, that your Customer wants to return their purchased product/service and request for a refund. Currently, Maesh does not have any automated refund policy in place. In case you‚Äôd like to do a refund to your Customer and the Transaction has not been settled yet into your bank account, please reach out to us on <a href="mailto:hello@maesh.io?subject=Refund Request"> hello@maesh.io</a>. Otherwise, if the payout for the said transaction has been made before the refund was requested, refunds are the responsibility of the merchant.

                        To keep our Fees as low as possible, we use the GIRO payment rails to settle all outstanding amounts (‚ÄúPayout‚Äù). Depending on the time of day and the day of the week, it may take between 1-5 days for the settlement to arrive in your bank account. Do note that these Payout rules are not dictated by us, but by our banking partner:

                                Payouts only happen on business days (weekend days and holidays will not have payouts)

                            <li>
                                The cut-off time for a Payout is on the next business day at 4PM

                            A Transaction for your business is successful and arrives on Monday morning at 11AM. The Payout will be the next business day: Tuesday (1 day later).
